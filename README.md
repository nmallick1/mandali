# Mandali

> *Mandali (मंडली, pronounced "mun-da-lee") — Sanskrit: a circle of specialists that deliberates and acts together*

Autonomous multi-agent collaborative development system using GitHub Copilot SDK

## Prerequisites

Before using Mandali, ensure the following are installed:

| Requirement | How to install |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Python 3.10+** | [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) |
| **Node.js 18+** | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (required for Copilot CLI) |
| **GitHub Copilot CLI** | `winget install GitHub.Copilot` or `npm install -g @github/copilot` |
| **GitHub Copilot license** | Active Copilot Individual, Business, or Enterprise subscription |

**Verify your setup:**
```bash
python --version      # 3.10 or higher
copilot --version     # Should print the CLI version
```

> **Tip:** If the CLI is installed but not in your PATH, set the `COPILOT_CLI_PATH` environment variable to point directly at the binary.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install github-copilot-sdk pyyaml rich

# Default: Point at existing plan files and launch agents
python mandali.py --plan phases/_INDEX.md --out-path ./output

# Default: Prompt with references to existing plan files
python mandali.py --prompt "Read phases/_CONTEXT.md and phases/_INDEX.md. Complete all phases." --out-path ./my-project

# Opt-in: Generate a NEW plan from scratch via interview
python mandali.py --prompt "Add caching to the API layer" --generate-plan --out-path ./output

# Control verification retries (default: 5, set 0 to disable verification)
python mandali.py --plan phases/_INDEX.md --out-path ./output --max-retries 3
```

---

## MCP Server Configuration

The orchestrator automatically loads MCP server configuration from:
1. `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` (user config - primary)
2. `.copilot/mcp-config.json` (project config - fallback)

The orchestrator also passes the user's `~/.copilot` config directory to agent sessions, so locally installed **skills and extensions** are available to all persona agents.

### Example mcp-config.json

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aspire": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": "aspire",
      "args": ["mcp", "start"],
      "tools": ["*"]
    },
    "playwright": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": "npm",
      "args": ["exec", "--yes", "--", "@playwright/mcp@latest"],
      "tools": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

Agents will have access to all configured MCP servers, enabling them to:
- Query databases
- Browse web pages
- Interact with APIs
- Access specialized development tools

---

## Phased Plan Structure (Recommended for Large Projects)

For large projects, plans are split into multiple files to prevent context loss:

```
<out-path>/
├── phases/
│   ├── _CONTEXT.md           # Global context (READ FIRST)
│   │                         # Architecture, security, non-negotiables
│   ├── _INDEX.md             # Phase tracking table with status
│   │                         # Agents update this after each phase
│   ├── phase-01-foundation.md
│   ├── phase-02-core.md
│   ├── phase-03-feature.md
│   └── ...
└── mandali-artifacts/        # Orchestration files (auto-created)
    ├── conversation.txt
    ├── satisfaction.txt
    └── DecisionsTracker.md
```

### Why Phased Files?

| Single File Plan | Phased File Structure |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Context lost in long documents | Each phase is self-contained |
| Easy to miss tasks | Clear task numbering (XX.Y) |
| Hard to track progress | _INDEX.md shows status |
| Agents forget constraints | _CONTEXT.md always available |

### File Purposes

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `_CONTEXT.md` | **Read first** - Architecture, security, non-negotiables that apply to ALL phases |
| `_INDEX.md` | **Tracking** - Phase table with status, commits, dependencies |
| `phase-XX-*.md` | **Implementation** - Detailed tasks for one phase with quality gates |

---

## Usage

### Command Line Arguments

```bash
python mandali.py [OPTIONS]
```

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `--out-path <path>` | **Yes** | Output directory where Mandali creates files. If inside a git repo, a worktree is created automatically for isolation |
| `--plan <path>` | One of plan/prompt | Path to existing plan (_INDEX.md or single plan.md) |
| `--prompt <text>` | One of plan/prompt | Prompt with instructions and references to plan files |
| `--generate-plan` | No (default: off) | Opt-in: run interview + plan generation instead of direct launch |
| `--stall-timeout <minutes>` | No (default: 5) | Minutes of inactivity before human escalation |
| `--max-retries <n>` | No (default: 5) | Max verification rounds after all agents SATISFIED. Set 0 to disable |
| `--verbose` | No | Show detailed status updates |
| `--describe <persona>` | No | Show detailed description of a persona (dev, security, pm, qa, sre) |

### Examples

```bash
# Direct launch with existing plan file
python mandali.py --plan ./phases/_INDEX.md --out-path ./output

# Direct launch with prompt referencing existing files
python mandali.py --prompt "Read phases/_CONTEXT.md and phases/_INDEX.md. Complete all phases." --out-path ./output

# Generate a NEW plan from scratch (opt-in)
python mandali.py --prompt "Add Redis caching for API responses" --generate-plan --out-path ./output/redis-caching

# Longer timeout for complex tasks
python mandali.py --plan phases/_INDEX.md --out-path ./output --stall-timeout 10
```

### What is `--stall-timeout`?

The `--stall-timeout` option controls how long the orchestrator waits before escalating to a human when agents stop making progress.

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `5` (default) | After 5 minutes of no conversation activity, pause agents and ask human for guidance |
| `10` | More patient - good for complex implementations where agents may take longer |
| `2` | Aggressive - escalate quickly if you want tight human oversight |

**When stall is detected:**
1. Orchestrator injects: `@AllAgents - Escalating to @HUMAN for guidance`
2. All agents pause and update status to `PAUSED`
3. Human is presented with options:
   - Provide guidance (relayed to agents)
   - View recent conversation
   - Abort

---

## Modes

### Default: Direct Launch (no `--generate-plan`)

By default, the orchestrator **skips** interview, plan generation, and AI review. It assumes you already have plan files ready.

#### With `--plan`

Reads the plan file, uses LLM to discover all referenced artifacts (up to 5 levels deep), copies them to the workspace, and launches agents.

```bash
python mandali.py --plan ./phases/_INDEX.md --out-path ./output
```

#### With `--prompt`

The LLM extracts file/folder paths mentioned in your prompt, reads those files, recursively discovers any files they reference (up to 5 levels), copies everything to the workspace, and launches agents. Your prompt is passed as additional context alongside the plan.

```bash
python mandali.py --prompt "Read phases/_CONTEXT.md and phases/_INDEX.md. Start from Phase 3." --out-path ./my-project
```

**What happens:**
1. 🔍 LLM extracts paths: `phases/_CONTEXT.md`, `phases/_INDEX.md`
2. 🔍 Reads those files, discovers nested references (depth 1/5, 2/5, ...)
3. 📁 Copies all artifacts to workspace
4. ✅ Shows you what was found — you confirm or reject
5. 🚀 Launches agents with plan + prompt as context

#### Prompt Tips

Reference your plan files explicitly in the prompt:
- ✅ `"Read phases/_CONTEXT.md and phases/_INDEX.md. Complete all phases."`
- ✅ `"Follow the plan in phases/_INDEX.md. Start from Phase 3."`
- ❌ `"Continue the implementation"` (no file references — orchestrator won't find plan files)

### Opt-in: Plan Generation (`--generate-plan`)

Add `--generate-plan` to trigger the full interview and plan generation flow. Only works with `--prompt`.

1. **AI Interviewer** - Asks clarifying questions about scope, phases, existing context
2. **Plan Generation** - Creates phased file structure (_CONTEXT.md, _INDEX.md, phase-XX.md files)
3. **User Approval** - Shows plan directory, you review/edit externally, then accept or reject
4. **Plan Review** - AI validates phased structure
5. **Agent Launch** - 5 personas begin autonomous work

```bash
python mandali.py --prompt "Add rate limiting to the API" --generate-plan --out-path ./output
```

---

## Workspace Isolation (Git Worktrees)

When `--out-path` points to a directory inside a git repository, Mandali automatically creates a **git worktree** in a sibling directory. Agents work entirely in the worktree — your original directory is never touched.

```
myproject/                        ← your repo (untouched)
myproject-mandali-20260210-053400/ ← worktree (agents work here)
```

**What happens:**
1. Mandali detects `--out-path` is inside a git repo
2. Creates a branch `mandali/session-<timestamp>`
3. Creates a worktree at `<parent>/<dirname>-mandali-<timestamp>/`
4. Redirects all agent work to the worktree
5. After the run, shows instructions to merge or discard

**After the run:**
```bash
# Review what agents changed
git diff main..mandali/session-20260210-053400

# Keep the changes
cd myproject
git merge mandali/session-20260210-053400

# Or discard everything
git worktree remove ../myproject-mandali-20260210-053400
git branch -D mandali/session-20260210-053400
```

**When `--out-path` is NOT inside a git repo**, no worktree is created and agents work directly in the specified directory (same as before).

---

## Interactive Monitoring

While agents work, you see periodic status updates:

```
[14:32:15] 📊 ✅dev 🔧sec ⏳pm ⏳qa ⏳sre | 12 msgs
           └─ @Dev: Implementing Phase 1 task 1.1, writing tests first...
```

**Status icons:**
| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| ✅ | SATISFIED - Agent's criteria are met |
| 🔧 | WORKING - Agent is actively working |
| 🔴 | BLOCKED - Agent is blocked on something |
| ⏳ | Waiting - Agent is waiting for others |

**You can type a message at any time** to interject. Your message is injected as:
```
@AllAgents - Human says:
[your message]
```

All agents will see and respond to your guidance.

---

## Agent Communication

### Protocol

| Mention | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `@Dev` | Addressing Developer |
| `@Security` | Addressing Security Architect |
| `@PM` | Addressing Product Manager |
| `@QA` | Addressing QA Engineer |
| `@SRE` | Addressing SRE |
| `@Team` or `@AllAgents` | Addressing everyone |
| `@HUMAN` | Human arbiter (injected by orchestrator) |

### Turn-Taking Rules

1. **When to speak:**
   - You are @mentioned
   - Discussion is in your domain (security issue → @Security speaks)
   - You have concerns about current work
   - Handoff to you: "@QA please test"

2. **When to stay quiet:**
   - You're not mentioned and it's not your domain
   - Implementation is in progress (unless you spot an issue)
   - Your feedback was already addressed

### conversation.txt Format

```
[21:15:00] @PM: @Team - I've reviewed the plan. Acceptance criteria look clear.
@Dev, you can start with Phase 1. SATISFACTION_STATUS: WORKING

[21:16:30] @DEV: @PM - Acknowledged. Starting Phase 1 implementation.
Creating SkillParser.cs... @QA - Ready for testing when available.
SATISFACTION_STATUS: WORKING

[21:18:00] @SECURITY: @Dev - Quick concern on line 45. You're not validating
the input path. This could allow path traversal. Please add validation.
SATISFACTION_STATUS: BLOCKED - Path traversal vulnerability
```

## Human Escalation Flow

**Trigger:** No conversation activity for N minutes, or agent requests `@HUMAN`.

**Escalation message (injected by orchestrator):**
```
@AllAgents - Escalating to @HUMAN for guidance.
Please pause your current work. Wait for human input before continuing.

Current status:
- @Dev: WORKING
- @Security: BLOCKED - Disagreement on encryption approach
- @PM: SATISFIED
- @QA: WORKING
- @SRE: SATISFIED
```

**Agents respond by:**
1. Finishing any atomic operation
2. Updating status to `PAUSED - Awaiting human guidance`
3. Stopping until human responds

**Human response (injected by orchestrator):**
```
@AllAgents - Human guidance:
Use AES-256-GCM. This is a company standard.
@Security, update requirements. @Dev, proceed with this approach.
```

Agents acknowledge, update status to WORKING/SATISFIED, and continue.

## Prior Art Acknowledgment

This system implements the **multi-agent collaborative development pattern**, which is an established approach in AI research. Key prior art includes:

| Framework | Year | Contribution |
|-----------|------|--------------|
| **Society of Mind** (Minsky) | 1986 | Theoretical foundation - intelligence emerges from agent interaction |
| **CAMEL** | 2023 | Debate-based agents that challenge each other |
| **ChatDev** | 2023 | Role-based software development with "communicative dehallucination" |
| **MetaGPT** | 2023 | SOP-driven pipeline with structured document handoffs |
| **AutoGen** | 2023 | Async multi-agent with SocietyOfMindAgent consensus |
| **CrewAI** | 2023 | Role/task/crew abstractions for workflow orchestration |

We do not claim to have invented multi-agent collaborative development.

---

## What This Implementation Adds

Our contribution is **practical refinements for production/unsupervised use**:

### 1. Autonomous Self-Organization
- Agents communicate via @mentions in shared conversation file
- No turn-taking orchestration - agents decide when to speak
- Natural collaboration with "When to Respond" / "When to Stay Quiet" rules

### 2. Design Discussion Phase
- @PM leads design discussion before implementation
- @Security raises all concerns at design time (not during implementation)
- Team agrees on phase structure, then executes

### 3. TDD + PoC Phased Development
- **Phase 1**: Minimal working version (happy path + tests FIRST)
- **Phase 2**: Error handling + tests
- **Phase 3**: Edge cases + tests
- **Phase 4**: Polish, security hardening, optimization

### 4. Explicit Conflict Resolution
- **Tie-breaker rules**: Security wins security disputes; PM wins other conflicts
- **2-strike rule**: After raising same concern twice, agent MUST propose solution
- **Self-unblocking**: Agents resolve blockers themselves (e.g., Security writes the test if Dev won't) rather than staying BLOCKED indefinitely
- **DecisionsTracker.md**: Deviation log — records where implementation differs from the plan, so a human can review and decide whether to keep or discard the work
- **Pre-action conversation check**: Every agent checks the last 50 lines of conversation before their key action (committing, reviewing, declaring complete)

### 5. Human Escalation
- Stall detection triggers human escalation
- Agents pause gracefully, await guidance
- Human input relayed as `@HUMAN` message

### 6. Trust but Verify — Post-Implementation Verification Loop
- After all agents declare `SATISFIED`, a **verification agent** compares plan vs actual implementation
- The verification agent reads actual code — it does not blindly trust status claims
- **DecisionsTracker.md entries are treated as intentional** — not flagged as gaps
- Verification is **pragmatic, not strict** — alternative implementations that achieve the same goal are fine
- If gaps are found: `conversation.txt` is archived (timestamped), `satisfaction.txt` is reset, and the team is **relaunched** with a gap report
- Up to `--max-retries` rounds (default 5); set to `0` to disable verification (old behavior)
- Each round gets a fresh conversation to keep agent context windows clean

## Personas

| Role | Focus | Tie-Breaker Authority |
|------|-------|----------------------|
| **Dev** | Implementation, TDD, code quality | - |
| **Security** | Threat modeling, secure defaults | TIER 1 (wins security disputes) |
| **PM** | Acceptance criteria, user delight | TIER 2 (wins UX/scope disputes) |
| **QA** | Testing, user journey, edge cases | - |
| **SRE** | Observability, reliability, failure modes | - |

## Prior Art

This system builds on ideas from several multi-agent frameworks:

| Framework | Key Influence |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Ralph Wiggum** | Iterative feedback loop pattern |
| **Gas Town** | File-based persistence, CLI integration |
| **AutoGen** | Multi-agent conversation patterns |
| **CrewAI** | Role-based specialization |
| **MetaGPT/ChatDev** | Software team role modeling |

See **[PRIOR_ART.md](./PRIOR_ART.md)** for detailed comparison, limitations of existing frameworks, and how our approach addresses them.

## What's Next

### 🔮 Emulate Me Mode

What if the agents didn't just play generic roles — but played *you*?

Mandali can already orchestrate five specialists. The next step: teach them how *you* think. Your code review instincts. Your bias toward simplicity or thoroughness. The concerns you always raise. The ones you never do.

One command. Autonomous agents. Your voice!

*Coming soon: `--as-me`*
