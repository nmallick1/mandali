# Decisions Tracker

> **Deviation log for human review.** This file records choices that shaped the implementation — where the team deviated from the plan, made choices the plan left open, or added/changed scope. A human reads this after the session to diff "what I asked for" vs "what I got."

---

## How to Use

When you make a choice that a human comparing the plan to the implementation should know about:
1. Add a new entry below using the template
2. Increment the decision number
3. Fill all fields — no field should be empty

**What to record:**
- You deviated from what the plan specified
- You made a choice the plan left open / didn't specify
- You added, removed, or changed scope
- You made a tradeoff (chose A over B)

**What NOT to record:**
- Routine implementation that follows the plan exactly
- Discussion that didn't result in a choice
- Intermediate steps that led to the final decision

**Check this file before proposing changes** — settled decisions should not be re-litigated unless new information emerges.
